# Restaurant App 🍔

A simple yet powerful restaurant ordering system that lets you order food just like in the real world - but way faster!

## What it does

Ever been to a restaurant and wished ordering was simpler? well this app solves that.... all u have to do ...just press 2-3 numbers (like choosing from an index), and boom - you've got your order ready.

The coolest part? With just 3 buttons, you can create 

_______________________________________128 different burger combinations_______________________

Yeah, this is true
and it's just about Burger... as I will introduce more dishes it may cross 1000+ combinations by just 7-8 buttons 

Features :- 
Super easy ordering - just use numbers to navigate the menu
Tons of customization - mix and match ingredients however you want
Real-world pricing -  handles money, taxes, and everything a real restaurant app needs
Clean interface - no confusing menus - just simple number choices

Why I built this??????????????

In the begining, i just wanted to make a project to learn SOLID principles, but as i keep working on this i started to love it and adding moe and more things in it to make it a real world prblem solver

## Current status

✅ Core ordering system works  
✅ All the money/tax calculations are done  
✅ Menu system with multiple combinations  
🚧 Still adding more dishes and features

This project taught me a lot about handling complex logic while keeping the user experience dead simple.
